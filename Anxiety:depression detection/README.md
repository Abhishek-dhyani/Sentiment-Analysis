I have built a discussion forum using **Discourse** which analyzes the user's post and comments that are run through a trained **NLP (Artificial Intelligence)** model built using **NLTK** which gives a score of the likeliness of the person having **depression** (<-0.8) and a tag which tells about the status of the likeliness of **anxiety**.
